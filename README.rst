This repository is for homework assignments for `Numerical Software Development
(NYCU 2022 spring)
<https://yyc.solvcon.net/en/latest/nsd/schedule/nsd_22sp_nycu.html>`__.

To turn in your submission, you need to clone this repository, and create a
`pull request (PR) <https://github.com/yungyuc/nsdhw_22sp/pulls>`__.  Your
cloned repository needs to be public on GitHub.  The branch of your PR needs to
start with ``<github-user-name>-hw#``, e.g., ``myname-hw2-attempt1``.

The code in your PR shouldn't duplicate with your classmates'.  Once
duplication is found, the latter submitter should modify the code.  One way to
avoid the hassle is to submit (a correct answer, of course) as early as
possible.
